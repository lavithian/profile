    <h3>Unlicensed Lifeguard</h3>
    <p>
      Despite lacking a license, I can ensure that <strong>EVERYONE</strong> can swim between the flags <br >
      and that <strong>NO ONE</strong> swims too far. But if they do, I will make sure that no one can find them. <br >
      It's not a threat, it's an professional courtesy.
